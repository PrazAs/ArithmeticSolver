# ArithmeticSolver
A demo application demonstrating the usage of the `MathSolver` class. This is a WIP and nothing inside should be considered stable.

### Installation
`ArithmeticSolver` uses [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) for dependency management.  

Install carthage:
```bash
$ brew install carthage
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
$ pwd
/local/path/to/repository/

$ carthage update
```

### TODO
- [ ] Move `MathSolver` to it's own framework.
- [ ] Add support for parsing decimal numbers.
- [ ] Add support for parsing negative numbers.
- [ ] Add support for solving algebraic expressions.
