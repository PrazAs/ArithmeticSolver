# ArithmeticSolver
A demo application demonstrating the usage of the `MathSolver` class. This is a WIP and nothing inside should be considered stable.

### TODO
- [ ] Move `MathSolver` to it's own framework.
- [ ] Add support for parsing decimal numbers.
- [ ] Add support for parsing negative numbers.
- [ ] Add support for solving algebraic expressions.
